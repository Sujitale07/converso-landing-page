        question: "How does the location-based routing work?",
        answer: "Connectapre detects the visitor's location via IP address or GPS. It then automatically matches them to the assigned agent for that City, State, or Country. If no specific agent is found, a default agent is shown."
    },
    {
        question: "Does it support group chats or only individual numbers?",
        answer: "Currently, Connectapre routes to individual WhatsApp numbers (using the wa.me link format), making it ideal for support teams and sales agents."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if an agent is offline?",
        answer: "Agents can be manually toggled to 'Offline' in the dashboard. If an agent is offline, they will be skipped in the routing logic and the system will try to find another match or show the default agent."
    },
    {
        question: "Did you say I can track clicks?",
        answer: "Yes! The built-in Analytics Dashboard tracks every click, along with the visitor's location, source page, and the specific agent who handled the chat."
